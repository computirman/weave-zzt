#           !!! IMPORTANT !!!
# Any line starting with a '#' is a comment.
# If you remove lines that don't start with '#',
# you WILL screw up your file.
#          You have been warned.

#How to Use:
#Copy TEMPLATE.OOP to <YOURZZT>.OOP and
#follow the instructions below to add new
#functions to ZZT.  If you want to add
#all available functions, instead copy
#EXTENDED.OOP to <YOURZZT>.OOP and follow
#the instructions there to customize your
#setup.
#  -------------

_nil
# ---- COLOR command
# Usage:

#By changing the values below you can add
#new options for #IF <condition> in ZZT.
# ---- DETECT condition
# Usage:
#        #if detect <direction> <type>

# Set to BY below to add to OOP:
_nil

# Usage:
#        /at <X> <Y>
