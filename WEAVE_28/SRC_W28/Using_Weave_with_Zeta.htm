        <p>If you want to run WeaveZZT on a modern machine, you will need an <b>emulation environment</b>, as Weave is a native DOS executable.</p>
        <p>To use Zeta in Windows (the most common setup) you will need the following files from the latest zeta download at <a href="https://zeta.asie.pl/">https://zeta.asie.pl/</a>:
        <ul><li>zeta86.exe</li><li>SDL2.dll</li></ul>
        You will copy those into a directory, say C:\Weave, and extract the contents of your WeaveZZT download into that same directory.<br><center><img src="IMAGES/HOWTO1.PNG"></center></p>
        <p>Make a copy of the WEAVE28.EXE file and rename it to ZZT.EXE. The ZZT.EXE and zeta86.exe should be in the same directory.<br><center><img src="IMAGES/HOWTO2.PNG"></center></p>
        <p>Run zeta86.exe. If everything's working correctly, the WeaveZZT Demo world, WEAVEDMO, will come up, which shows off many enhanced features stock ZZT can't use.<br><center><img src="IMAGES/HOWTO3.PNG"></center></p>
        <p>As always, join us in the ZZT discord (<a href="https://museumofzzt.com/discord/">https://museumofzzt.com/discord/</a>) or MGG Discord (<a href="https://discord.gg/jkUkhxJEpC">https://discord.gg/jkUkhxJEpC</a>) if you've got any questions or are interested in seeing what else you can do with WeaveZZT.</p>
