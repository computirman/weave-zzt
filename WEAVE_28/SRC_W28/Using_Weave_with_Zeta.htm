If you want to run Weave on a modern machine, you will need an <b>emulation environment</b>, as Weave is a native DOS executable. If you want to use Zeta in Windows (the most common setup) you will need the following files from the latest zeta download at <a href="https://zeta.asie.pl/">https://zeta.asie.pl/</a>:
        <ul>
        <li>zeta86.exe</li>
        <li>SDL2.dll</li>
        </ul>
        You will copy those into the same directory where the .ZZT file is located you wish to run.  Make a copy of the FWEAVE28.EXE file and rename it to ZZT.EXE, and make sure that is in the same directory as the <b>zeta86.exe</b> above. Then, run zeta86.exe to play your game.<br><br><a href="https://meangirls.itch.io/weave-2">https://meangirls.itch.io/weave-2</a>
