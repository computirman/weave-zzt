FixWeave 1.0
Part of the Weave 2 Project

- - - - -

What is it?

  This is a tool intended to take otherwise unmodified older games and, similar to a "wrapper" that recontextualizes the inputs and outputs of an executable, changes the way that existing file is presented to the player.
  
  While there are some generally fixed bugs and crashes, the main purpose of this branch of Weave 2 is for the injection of "fixes" into the boards. See the documentation for details.

  This version presupposes an existing understanding of FirmWeave and its functions. If you haven't yet, download FirmWeave and become familiar with it if you want to make use of the extended functionality.

If you have questions, if something doesn't behave as described, or if I've missed something crucial that needs to be added, head on over to the Discord of ZZT and let me know. Thanks.
