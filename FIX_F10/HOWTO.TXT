$HOW TO USE FIXWEAVE

To start:
  * Create a <filename>.INI and <filename>.CFG file with any appropriate changes.

To fix a board:
  * On any board where a fix is required, create a file:
     * <filename>.<board#> (no leading zeroes)
  * This will include object code that will run immediately before the board loads for the first time.
  * The object will be destroyed immediately upon executing for the first time.
  * The object will ignore line limits. 
     * This means you can freeze the game - be warned
  * Note: you have access to all enabled FirmWeave directions and functions.
     * Example: by using #load at <x> <y> <file>, you can replace broken code.

And that's it for now.
