Soft Weave 2.2a
Part of the Weave 2 Project

What is it?

  If you run your ZZT 3.2 compatible games with Soft Weave it will play them exactly as 3.2 does, bugs and all.  The only difference is it attempts to load them into EMS/XMS. If your machine or emulator does not have either of those, Weave 2 will probably not work. Sorry, them's the breaks.

  If you want to enhance games, you may change many fundamental strings, sounds, and attributes by copying the provided TEMPLATE.CFG and TEMPLATE.PAR files and renaming them the same name as your .ZZT file, then altering them per the directions in the template files themselves. Changes to the files will take effect on reload of the .ZZT world.

How use it?

  Enhancement can take many forms. You can tweak the amount of damage done by enemies and hazards or increase the benefit of helpful items, creating an "easy mode" for an existing classic game. You can customize the look of a player to increase "immersion", inasfar as ZZT is able to lay claim to that term. Is it really a white on blue smiley smooching those kobolds? Or would a blue dragon avatar be more your speed?

  You could also choose to put in some wild settings and develop a brand new game that takes the core mechanics of ZZT, plus a couple tweaks, and gives us something totally new. That's good because now you I can play all the cool games y'all will make when like, tigers are char 2 and the player is char 227 or whatever. (call it "Life of Tiger")

What isn't it?

  Soft Weaving is not mysterious.  Every change is in plain text and can be viewed by anyone who wants to play your game.

  Soft Weaving is not definitive.  You can't like, #put pushers that default to pushing north, or change the color rules for text or passages and stuff like that. SoftWeave maintains FULL backward compatibility and avoids maintaining separate code pathways for standard and modified content. For more adventurous tweaking, please use FirmWeave.

  Soft Weaving is not indestructible. If you put insane crap into your .PAR file you can probably crash ZZT. However I've been surprised by how well ZZT's logic copes with what should be impossible, so don't be shy. Just remember to back up your .CFG and .PAR files and guard them the same you would a .ZZT file.  They're part of the game now.

  Everyone's Weaver status will be revoked on January 1, 2022. You'll have to earn it back; it's my hope that Soft Weaving is a pathway to doing that.

  As always, hit me up in the ZZT Discord if you've got feedback or there's something to add. I'm not married to anything here so if there's a better way to do something, or you REALLY have to have like, breakable linewalls or walkable ricochets or something, later versions of SoftWeave could open that up.
