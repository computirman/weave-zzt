Firm Weave 2.0
Part of the WeaveZZT 2.0 Project

What is it?

  If you run your 3.2 compatible games with FirmWeave it will play them mostly as 3.2 does; bugs are fixed, #put no longer leaves holes in your nice floors, overall the experience is nicer.  The main difference is it attempts to load them into EMS/XMS. If your machine or emulator does not have either of those, WeaveZZT 2.0 will probably not work. Sorry, them's the breaks.

  If you want to enhance games, there are a lot of different files you can add, and each will enhance the game in different ways.  Have a look at the TEMPLATE files that came with FirmWeave for more. Also, play FIRMDEMO.ZZT and learn about the different options that can be added to ZZT.

 If you want to learn more about how to change ZZT's default strings, sounds, and the built-in behavior of lions, tigers, and the like, then you will want to check out Soft Weave, also part of the WeaveZZT 2.0 project.

If you have questions, if something doesn't behave as described, or if I've missed something crucial that needs to be added, head on over to the Discord of ZZT and let me know. Thanks.
