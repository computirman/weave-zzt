WeaveZZT 3.2
Part of the WeaveZZT Project

--> What is it?

If you run your ZZT 3.2 compatible games with WeaveZZT it will play them as 3.2 does, with some exceptions.

--> How is it different?

Almost all crashes are gone, conveyors aren't bugged, #put no longer leaves holes in the floor. Overall the experience is nicer.

--> How is it the same?

In all the ways that matter, it is the same as playing in ZZT 3.2 - You can use WEAVE3.EXE as your main ZZT executable, and unless you're playing a small handful of known old games that rely on obscure ZZT bugs to work, you will have the same or better experience.

--> What should I watch out for?

Weave3 attempts to load your ZZT files into EMS/XMS. If your machine or emulator does not have those, WeaveZZT will probably not work.

--> What can I do with it?

For a sampling of what you can do with Weave3, check out the WEAVEDMO.ZZT file included with the Weave3 download.

--> Okay, but WHAT CAN I DO WITH IT?

You can add a .CFG file if you want to change the way ZZT sounds, the messages it displays, or the look of default items, terrains and text.

You can add a .INI file if you want to change elements of ZZT-OOP - you can add new flags, new counters, execute new commands, and load external files.

You can add a WEAVEZZT.CFG file if you want to play regular ZZT games with accessibility options like unique keyshapes and visual representations of sound.

If you have a .INI file added to your game already, you can add .OBJ files to load or run ZZT-OOP code in real time.

For further explanation about any of the above, see the WEAVEDMO.ZZT file.

--> Anything else?

There are tools provided along with Weave 3 for use in creating Weave and Web-playable ZZT games. They are in the TOOLS folder as follows:

LOOMZZT.ZIP
 - A hacked version of KevEdit to make Weave 3 game creation easier, with syntax highlighting, limit removal and custom text support.

WEBWEAVE.ZIP
 - A quick drag-and-drop utility to turn your WeaveZZT files into web-playable content.

WEBZZT32.ZIP
 - Same as above, but for ZZT 3.2 files.

ZLOOM2.ZIP
 - A hacked version of zedit2 with custom text support.

--> What Software License does this use?

With the exception of LOOMZZT, Weave 3 is MIT licensed. See LICENSE.TXT for details.

LOOMZZT is GPL-licensed. For details about its license, see the README.MD file included in the LOOMZZT source, provided with the program.


--> I still have questions.

If you have questions, if something doesn't behave as described, or if I've missed something crucial that needs to be added, head on over to the Discord of ZZT and let me know. Thanks.
