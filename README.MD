# WeaveZZT 3.0

With Weave 3, all previous recommendations for Weave have been addressed and the design specifications are frozen. It is the culmination of the Weave project.

Designed with the full scope of the ZZTer audience in mind, this version hopes to supply the needs of anyone that wants to tweak something about ZZT. Weave 2 made use of several accessory files to allow ZZTers to enhance their game's experience without diving into the Pascal code. Weave 3 restricts this to just two, with the following goals:

 - .CFG file weaving: To make cosmetic and rule changes about ZZT without expanding ZZT-OOP.
 - .INI file weaving: To expand ZZT-OOP with more counters, commands, and keybind inputs.

In the absence of any accompanying .CFG or .INI file, WEAVE3.EXE is designed to play normal ZZT games with sufficiently faithful accuracy that players won't be able to tell the difference. The exception is the removal of bugs that crash or softlock the game (as opposed to bugs frequently abused by adept ZZTers).

## Using

With your own copy of Turbo Pascal 5.5, you can compile WEAVE3.EXE yourself using the BUILDW30.BAT file provided in the WEAVE_30 subdirectory. Just make sure the TPC.EXE and TURBO.TPL files are in the same directory as the BUILDW30.BAT file. (These are DOS executables you will need a DOS emulator to compile.)

## Types of weaving

There are two primary types of weaving, as noted above. These center around the .CFG and .INI files that can accompany a Weave game.

For examples of .CFG weaving, look at the TEMPLATE.CFG and EXTENDED.CFG example files in the WEAVE_30/SRC_W30 subdirectory.

For examples of .INI weaving, look at the TEMPLATE.INI file in the WEAVE_30/SRC_W30 subdirectory. Additionally, the inclusion of a .INI file unlocks new ZZT-OOP commands, some of which allow you to use other external files. For examples of those, have a look at the .OBJ files in that same subdirectory.

## Questions

Hit me up in the ZZT Discord if you've got feedback or there's something to add. I'm not married to anything here so if there's a better way to do something, please ping the discord in #zzt-programs and throw a suggestion in there. You may have also seen a FIX_F10 directory in the source code; this is for FixWeave, a project that has stalled and whose future is uncertain. A companion page for FixWeave is available on Itch at **meangirls dot itch dot io slash fixweave-2**
