The Weave Example Object Library (W.E.O.L.)
-------------------------------------------

A supplementary set of examples of what you can do with Weave, based on the examples set forth for ZZT in the original Z.E.O.L. series. 

You will need to provide your own emulation. Zeta, as with all Weave versions, is preferred.

The example objects are in the WEOL\lib folder.

These examples are designed for Weave 3.3u+ or later.
