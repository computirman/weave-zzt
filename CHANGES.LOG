= 1/2/2022: 2.2b

= 1/1/2022: 2.2a
Bugs Fixed:
 * Using #EDGE to set a board edge, if set to a board whose label doesn't exist, would set the eastern neighbor to board -1, with unexpected consequences.

Added:
 * You can now force the game to start on a specific board via an option in the .PAR file. (also in Softweave)

 * 'ACCESSIBLE' can be added to ZZT.CFG (where 'REGISTERED' was previously) to enable ACCZZT options on startup.
 * Underneath the word ACCESSIBLE in ZZT.CFG, the accessibility options can be pre-set: 'NEUROMOTORASSIST' for neuromotor assistance, 'VISUALSOUND' for visualized sound information, and/or 'KEYSHAPES' for distinct key shapes. If pre-set, accessibility options will not be asked for each startup. 'NONE' can also be used to skip the dialog entirely.

 * ?inspect cheat now reads local object counters, P values, Step values, and Cycle.
 * Text windows now match the sidebar theme. (Also in SoftWeave)
