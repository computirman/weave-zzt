2/5/2022: 2.5c
Bugs Fixed:
* Naming a counter the same name as an element (e.g. 'ammo') meant that #PUT and #CHANGE would default to element 46 unless both a foreground and background color were specified.

Added:
* Since Element 46 isn't going anywhere, decided to make it a custom text element CUSTOMTEXT that can be defined in the .CFG file and used in-game.

Improved:
* Added instructions to the .CFG files for VisibleInDark and Pushable element properties.

an object with the same stat # as the object calling BOARD to
#END prematurely.

Improved:
 * Spaces and non-alphanumeric characters in Keybinds will still show up in the sidebar but will be excluded from the label  sent, e.g. a keybind labeled "Foo-bar Gun" will send the label ":foobargun" when triggered.

= 1/3/2022: 2.2c
Bug Fixed:
 * SHOVE allowed you to shove objects past the southern border.
 * SHOVE destroyed tiles being shoved on top of the player if the player was otherwise blocked and couldn't be pushed.

Improved:

= 1/1/2022: 2.2a
Bugs Fixed:
 * Using #EDGE to set a board edge, if set to a board whose label doesn't exist, would set the eastern neighbor to board -1, with unexpected consequences.

Improved:

 * #EDGE will now throw an error if a nonexistent board is chosen or a direction without a neighbor such as <BY 1 3>

= 12/29/2021: 2.2
Added:
 * You can now force the game to start on a specific board via an option in the .PAR file. (also in Softweave)
 * New direction, /to <dir1> <dir2> which is the tile in the <dir2> direction from <dir1>. See the FIRMDEMO for details.
 * Added new global parameter KEYSPEED that sets the delay before key repeat to faster or slower.

Added:
 * ?stats cheat to read board stats

 * ?flags cheat to list all flags and custom parameters
 * 'ACCESSIBLE' can be added to ZZT.CFG (where 'REGISTERED' was previously) to enable ACCZZT options on startup.
 * Underneath the word ACCESSIBLE in ZZT.CFG, the accessibility options can be pre-set: 'NEUROMOTORASSIST' for neuromotor assistance, 'VISUALSOUND' for visualized sound information, and/or 'KEYSHAPES' for distinct key shapes. If pre-set, accessibility options will not be asked for each startup. 'NONE' can also be used to skip the dialog entirely.

Improved:
 * ?inspect cheat now reads local object counters, P values, Step values, and Cycle.
 * Text windows now match the sidebar theme. (Also in SoftWeave)
