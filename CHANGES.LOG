7/2/2022: FirmWeave 2.7i
Bugs Fixed:
* Raising the flag limit caused some flags to be set with incorrect names.
* Using #TAKE to reduce a counter by ARRAY would cause the counter to increase instead of decrease.
* Using #BOARD would cause PlayerX, PlayerY, ThisX, and ThisY to be incorrect for the remainder of the cycle.

6/22/2022: FirmWeave 2.7g
Added:
* other.flaglength configuration option that lets you set a shorter maximum flag length, giving you a higher flag limit.

6/20/2022: FirmWeave 2.7f
Fixed bugs:
* Identifying text by char via #if color was not working.

6/12/2022: FirmWeave 2.7e
Modified:
* Numbers in labels no longer behave any differently than letters in labels. 

6/8/2022: FirmWeave 2.7d
Improved:
* The /FIND direction is now substantially better at reaching its target, at the expense of being a little more chaotic.

New Features:
* You can now use SPACE to select or close text boxes.

6/8/2022: FirmWeave 2.7c
Fixed Bugs:
* The /FIND direction would struggle with wide open areas.

6/2/2022: FirmWeave 2.7b
Fixed bugs:
* Tiny hotfix for Weave. In rare circumstances, #set <counter> ARRAY would result in a large negative value. 

5/29/2022: FirmWeave 2.7
New Commands:
* #AND, the exact opposite of #ELSE - runs when the last IF statement was TRUE.
* #RUN <function>, runs the code in <function>.OBJ nonstop until the object either moves (#IDLE and /i count as movement) dies, or reaches an #END <response> command. #RUN functions can be called from within other #RUN functions, as a substitute for counter or other value, or as a conditional. Some examples:

	#RUN DEMO
This will run the contents of DEMO.OBJ.

	#GIVE AMMO RUN DEMO
This will run the contents of DEMO.OBJ and give ammo equal to the response value, passed by #END <value>.

	#IF RUN DEMO PUT N WATER
This will run the contents of DEMO.OBJ and #PUT N WATER if it reaches an #END TRUE command or an #END <value> with any positive value. It will do nothing if it reaches an #END FALSE, an #END <value> with a 0 or negative value, or if it reaches any other stopping point, such as a /i.

New Counters:
* BOARDID is a read-only counter that delivers the current board id.
* ARRAY is an object counter (like OBJ1, OBJ2 etc.) with a range of 0-127. It works in conjunction with the ^ character. If ^ is added to a #SEND label, the name of a counter, or the name of a file to be #LOAD-ed or #RUN, it will replace the ^ with whatever value is currently held in ARRAY.  Some examples:

	#SET ARRAY 5
	#SET LOCAL^ 15
This will set the LOCAL5 board counter to 15.

	#SET ARRAY 17
	#SEND OPTION^
This will send the object to the :OBJECT17 label, if it has one.

	#SET ARRAY 106
	#LOAD I EVENT^
This will replace the object's code with the contents of EVENT106.OBJ.

Improvements:
* Keys and Doors now have a "param2" parameter, which will offset each key/door character by that number. It occurred to me that people may want accessibility or key variety without the heavy-handed approach taken in the .CFG file, so this replicates that functionality with a bit more control.
* PSET can now set the object counters (obj1, obj2) of a given object, as well as set the CYCLE of any stat.

5/1/2022: FixWeave 1.0f and FirmWeave 2.6d
Bugs Fixed:
* Setting the properties of the 'EMPTY' element via CFG was not working.

4/30/2022: FixWeave 1.0f and FirmWeave 2.6d

Added:
* FixWeave 1.0, allowing zzt games to be patched on-the-fly

Fixed Bugs:
* Conveyors duplicating statted and nonstatted elements.

4/19/2022: 2.6rc4
Bugs Fixed:
* If you quit out and play a world again, some objects would lose their reference pointer to their code, resulting in a blank object.
* If you #board onto a new board, any walkable tile at the same X and Y as the object that issued the #board command would turn into an empty.
* Restoring saved games now correctly reflects the palette from when it was saved.

Improved:
* Quitting to title screen now restores the palette to the one in the .CFG file.

4/2/2022: 2.6rc3

* Updated the documentation related to local object counters.
* Cleaned up the example .INI files.

Added:
* #ELSE command that will execute the code that follows provided the most recent #IF condition run by that object failed.

Improved:
* The mousex and mousey read-only counters are collected whether or not mouse movement is enabled.
* SkipToTitle no longer automatically enables mouse movement.

2/15/2022: 2.5k

Bugs Fixed:
* The offsets for custom counters were off by six. They've been replaced with const values.


2/5/2022: 2.5c
Bugs Fixed:
* Naming a counter the same name as an element (e.g. 'ammo') meant that #PUT and #CHANGE would default to element 46 unless both a foreground and background color were specified.

Added:
* Since Element 46 isn't going anywhere, decided to make it a custom text element CUSTOMTEXT that can be defined in the .CFG file and used in-game.

Improved:
* Added instructions to the .CFG files for VisibleInDark and Pushable element properties.

2/2/2022: 2.5b
Bugs Fixed:
* Bullets decreasing currentStatTicked twice on death is now fixed in FirmWeave as well.

an object with the same stat # as the object calling BOARD to
#END prematurely.

Improved:

Bug Fixed:
 * SHOVE allowed you to shove objects past the southern border.
 * SHOVE destroyed tiles being shoved on top of the player if the player was otherwise blocked and couldn't be pushed.

Added:
 * Added the ability to configure which element is visible in dark. Defauts to torch.

Improved:
 * Expanded the capacity of '#if detect player' to check under the player, similar to '#if detect i' checking under the object.

= 1/1/2022: 2.2a
Bugs Fixed:
 * Using #EDGE to set a board edge, if set to a board whose label doesn't exist, would set the eastern neighbor to board -1, with unexpected consequences.

Improved:
 * #EDGE and #BOARD now accept counters as board names.  The board linked or sent to will be the value of the counter.
 * #EDGE will now throw an error if a nonexistent board is chosen or a direction without a neighbor such as <BY 1 3>

If pre-set, accessibility options will not be asked for each startup. 'NONE' can also be used to skip the dialog entirely.

Improved:
 * ?inspect cheat now reads local object counters, P values, Step values, and Cycle.
 * Text windows now match the sidebar theme. (Also in SoftWeave)

Other:
 * ZZT.DAT is not longer built, loaded, or included with FirmWeave; instead the ABOUT.HLP is baked into the executable.
