@Example Object - Well how about that!
Welcome!

This is the example object that you
loaded from the code with the #load
command!

Objects loaded in this way work just the
same as objects loaded in game; all the
usual functions work!

!link;You can use links!
#next
:link
Just like this!
!;Neat!
@next;Oh, very cool!
!option;Can I zap/restore links?
#next
:option
#zap !option
#restore !next
Sure you can!

... (shuffles some links around)
#link
:next
/i
You can move...
/rnd/rnd/rnd/rnd/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
#shoot rnd
You can execute commands!
/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i/i
#bind nextobj
